# Chef Alumni Code of Conduct

The purpose of this Slack group is to maintain connections with folks who once upon a time worked for Opscode/Chef Software Inc/Progress Chef. This is a safe space and we're here to reminisce and stay in touch with former (and in some cases, current) colleagues.

To ensure we create a safe, welcoming, and fair community, all Chef Alumni members are empowered to call out and attempt to resolve harmful behavior, and admins are empowered to enforce the Code of Conduct.

## The Short Version

Remember the No Asshole rule? Don’t be an ass, and if you think you’re being an ass, stop being an ass. You won't stop? That's why we can't have nice things.

We wish a code of conduct was as simple as the No Asshole Rule. But as we know from Chef, this rule can be interpreted subjectively and, therefore, applied misappropriately in some cases. This Code of Conduct makes the rules a little more explicit.

Be respectful of each other. Respectfully call out anyone behaving inappropriately, ask them to stop, and direct them to this Code of Conduct. If you need help resolving an issue, contact the admins. If you are unable to follow our Community Code of Conduct you will be removed from the Chef Alumni Slack group.

## The Longer Version

For many of us, our time at Chef was a once-in-a-career type of experience that created many fruitful connections that we still cherish to this day. That company and community somehow brought together a wide swath of amazing humans with diverse backgrounds, skills, talents, experiences, cultures, and opinions. To honor that, we create an inclusive environment in this Slack group, and we treat all individuals respectfully.

We have a large number of conversational topics - requests to shift a conversation to appropriate channels will frequently happen, and should be easily respected.

* We value respectful behavior above individual opinions.
* Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Engage with consideration and respect. Be kind, constructive, and helpful.
* Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or threatening behaviors.
* Focus on doing what is best for your overall community of former colleagues.
* Show empathy towards your former (and sometimes current) colleagues.
* If someone is violating this code of conduct, that doesn't give you the right to be abusive in return. Always be respectful.
* If you’re not sure, ask someone instead of assuming. No, really. Just ask the admins.
* Model respectful behaviour, but also address harmful behavior when you see it. One of the best ways to create a respectful community is to speak up when you see harmful behavior—and not just rely on admins to act!

### Resolve Peacefully

If you see someone behaving harmfully, we urge you to respectfully dissuade them from such behavior.

If you experience harmful behavior toward yourself or anyone else and feel in any way unable or unwilling to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately bring it to the attention of the admins who will listen and work to resolve the matter.

### Apologize and Do Better

Should you catch yourself behaving harmfully, or if someone calls you out on harmful behavior, please listen intently, own up to your words and actions, and apologize accordingly. No one is perfect, and we all make mistakes. What matters is how you handle your mistakes and learn from them.

Do better. Grow. Be an adult. Repeated patterns of harmful behavior will not be tolerated.

### Consequences

If the admins determine that someone is behaving harmfully, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate within the Chef Alumni Slack group, up to and including expulsion and exclusion.

Admins will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community. The admins can’t foresee every situation, and thus if in the admin's judgment the best thing to do is remove a harmful individual, they will do so.
